Configu uses the following terms to refer to different parts of your configuration pipeline:

<div className="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Configu Concept</th>

            </tr>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Configuration Schema</strong></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Configuration Set</strong></td>
                <td>A configuration <i>set</i> is where you assign values for your <i>schema</i> keys. The <i>sets</i> are organized in a tree structure, starting from the 'root' 'set', and enable inheritance. It is most often used to represent an environment and contains all the configuration values that are relevant to it.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Configuration Types</strong></td>
                <td>Configu enables pre-defined type validation on configuration keys. enforced <a href="/types">types</a> include (primitives, template strings, patterns, and more) Read more here for the full list of supported types.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Configuration Secret</strong></td>
                <td>A value within a <i>set</i> can be linked to a secret containing sensitive information, like database credentials. Configu integrates with the most prevelant secret managers, and does not store or send the actual secret, only a pointer to it that can only be used with your tokens.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Configuration Runtime</strong></td>
                <td>Configu supports automatic integration with many popular platforms such as Heroku, Netlify and many more, for truly centralized config management.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Configuration Format</strong></td>
                <td>The format that Configu needs to deliver the selected set in (JSON, YAML, dotenv, shell) Read more here for full list of supported formats.</td>
            </tr>

A list of all runtimes, types supported vaults and other features connected with these concepts are found in the app. 

## More About Configuration Schemas

Schemas are where you can declare all of the bits that your application is going to need in order to run 
under a variety of circumstances. These are a great place to start writing when you're working on a new 
app, while you're thinking about everything you're going to need.

## More About Configuration Sets

Sets are how you implement your schemas. Some sets might pull values for database credentials from a
secret manager, where the other might pull them from dotenv files you have locally. However, types remain the
same between sets (if `SITE_NAME` is type `string` in `-production`, it must also be a string in every
other set).
