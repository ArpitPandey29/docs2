| Configu Concept           | Explanation |
|-------------------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Configuration Schema**  | _Schemas_ are created from `.cfgu.json` files and imported into Configu. [Read more on how to import cfgu files](/docs/schemas) and create _schemas_.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Configuration Set**     | A configuration *set* is where you assign values for your _schema_ keys. The _sets_ are organized in a tree structure, starting from the 'root' 'set', and enable inheritance. It is most often used to represent an environment and contains all the configuration values that are relevant to it. |
| **Configuration Types**   | Configu enables pre-defined type validation on configuration keys. enforced [types](/docs/types) include (primitives, template strings, patterns, and more) Read more here for the full list of supported types.                                                                                    |
| **Configuration Secret**  | A value within a _set_ can be linked to a secret containing sensitive information, like database credentials. Configu integrates with the most prevelant secret managers, and does not store or send the actual secret, only a pointer to it that can only be used with your tokens.                |
| **Configuration Runtime** | Configu supports automatic integration with many popular platforms such as Heroku, Netlify and many more, for truly centralized config management.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Configuration Format**  | The format that Configu needs to deliver the selected set in (JSON, YAML, dotenv, shell) Read more here for full list of supported formats.                                                                                                                                                         |

A list of all runtimes, types supported vaults and other features connected with these concepts are found in the app. 

## More About Configuration Schemas

Schemas are where you can declare all of the bits that your application is going to need in order to run 
under a variety of circumstances. These are a great place to start writing when you're working on a new 
app, while you're thinking about everything you're going to need.

## More About Configuration Sets

Sets are how you implement your schemas. Some sets might pull values for database credentials from a
secret manager, where the other might pull them from dotenv files you have locally. However, types remain the
same between sets (if `SITE_NAME` is type `string` in `-production`, it must also be a string in every
other set).
