title: Exporting & Synchronizing Configurations
---

Once you have [declared your schema](/docs/schemas) and [created a set](/docs/sets), the Configu CLI 
is all you'll need in order to export and synchronize your configuration across your deployments, 
wherever they might be.

Configu CLI runs easily locally, on your CI/CD server, on your cluster, or anywhere that you need 
it to run. Configu CLI will work with any automation or orchestration software that you want to use.

## Exporting Your Configurations

When using the Configu CLI to export your configurations for the first time, we recommend using 
the CLI command generator (to reach the command generator, navigate to **Integrations** &rarr; 
**Configu CLI**)

You just have to make a few settings to tell Configu which schema and set you want to produce, 
and what runtime you're deploying to, and the command builder does the rest.

## Select How To Run (Locally, Or On The CI Server)

If you intend to run interactively, you'll need to make sure you're logged in and your CLI is 
connected and set to the correct organization. If you're setting up Configu to run on the CI/CD, 
[you'll need a token](/docs/administration) as the tool suggests.

## Select How You'd Like The Config Exported

Configu can deliver your configuration in a variety of ways:

 - **Print**: Print the configuration to standard output, or to a file, and select the desired format
 - **Template**: Output the configuration to a template file
 - **Source**: Export the configuration in a way that shell scripts/docker files can evaluate it
 - **Sync**: Synchronize the configuration directly to a supported runtime / IAAS / PAAS provider
(like Heroku, AWS, and more)

Using the command generator will also help to understand which flags Configu expects to see with each 
choice.

## Copy And Run The Command!

You'll see the command preview as you build it in the app. Once you're done, you can copy it, paste, 
insert any tokens that are required and Configu will handle the rest - here's what will happen:

 1.  Configu will make sure your client has the permissions to execute the command
 2.  Configu will look up the specified schema and set, stored in the selected stores
 3.  Configu will expand any template strings, and fetch any required secrets from the specified secret managers
 4.  Configu will complete the operation by outputting the config according to the flags you specified

## Don't Forget - Our Client Libraries Are Open Source!

We made the client libraries open source! We want you to add your own formats and runtimes if they 
don't already exist.
