All software is a combination of ***code*** that defines the software logic and ***configurations*** 
that customize the software behavior. Engineers typically store configurations as raw text across 
different places as opposed to code that is stored in a source control solution. This eventually leads 
to mismanagement and potentially critical production errors.

Configu is an E2E application configuration management platform for environment variables, secrets, 
feature flags, and ***any configuration related to code***. We provide engineering teams with 
a holistic set of tools to handle all aspects of configuration that prevent misconfigurations 
and critical failures from reaching production.

With Configu, teams can collaborate more effectively, be more productive, and have visibility, 
reliability, and security over configurations.
