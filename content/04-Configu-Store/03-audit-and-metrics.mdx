## Configu's Activity & Audit Log

To reach the activity log, navigate to **Activity** &rarr; **Audit Log**

Every time something changes or is exported, an entry showing the time, source and user logged in
(or Configu CLI if using a token) will be created. You can hover over each item to show more 
detail (who, what, where, when, why)

## Configuration Metrics

To view configuration metrics, navigate to **Activity** &rarr; **Metrics**
 
Here you can see information like the distribution of types in your schema,
export and push events, and details about the number of sets and schemas. These metrics are helpful
in tuning your configuration / build pipeline and provides critical observability.
