A ConfigSchema file (.cfgu.json or .cfgu.yaml) is a human-readable, open-source format for declaring configurations and their characteristics. It is designed to be stored in your source control alongside the code that uses these configurations, and is safe to be treated as code as it shouldn't contain sensitive data.

The ConfigSchema format provides a structured way to tie a configuration key as it appears in the code to its Cfgu properties, such as the type of data it represents (e.g., String, Number, Boolean), whether it is required or optional, and any constraints that should be applied. These bindings help to ensure that configuration data is properly validated and applied, and can help to prevent misconfigurations and errors from reaching production.

The name of the .cfgu file is used as its unique id (uid), and each Config created as input from it contains this uid and a configuration key from its contents.

.cfgu files essentially set the boundaries of different domains in the code relative to the configuration they use. Developers are free to organize and structure their .cfgu files in a way that makes sense for their specific needs and workflow. There is no limit on the number of .cfgu files that can be created, and they can be spread across different codebases, subfolders in the same project, and different repositories.

By using .cfgu files, teams can benefit from a clear and structured way to define and manage their configuration data, improving the efficiency and reliability of their software development and deployment processes, and facilitating collaboration among team members.

Here is an example of a ConfigSchema (.cfgu.json) file:
```json
{
  "API_KEY": {
    "type": "String",
    "required": true,
    "default": "abc123"
  }
}
```
This schema binds a configuration called "API_KEY" with a type of "String", which is required and has a default value of "abc123".


## [Configuration key](https://github.com/configu/configu/blob/main/types/ConfigSchema.ts#L21) ([Config.key](https://github.com/configu/configu/blob/main/types/Config.ts#L5))

A configuration key is the name of the configuration as it appears in the code. It is used to identify and reference a specific configuration, and can be used to access the value of the configuration in the code.

Here are some examples of how a config key named "CONFIG" might be used in various programming languages as an environment variable:

## [The Cfgu format](https://github.com/configu/configu/blob/main/types/Cfgu.ts)

The Cfgu format consists of a set of properties that specify important characteristics of a software configuration. Here is a list of the properties:

- `type`: The type of data that the configuration represents, such as String, Number, Boolean, [etc](/docs/cfgu-types). [Required]
- `pattern`: A regular expression that the configuration value must match. [Optional, type=Regex]
- `default`: A default value for the configuration, in case it is not provided. [Optional]
- `required`: Whether the configuration is required for the application to function properly. If set to true, the configuration must be provided. [Optional]
- `depends`: A list of other configurations that the current configuration depends on. [Optional]
- `template`: A string containing Mustache templates that can be used to construct a templated value from other configuration values. [Optional, type=String]
- `description`: A description of the configuration's role in the code. [Optional]

When these properties are attached to a configuration key in a ConfigSchema and used through the Configu interface (CLI/SDK), they are used to apply important and repeated validation on the configuration values, often implemented in the code.

## Working with ConfigSchemas

### Creating A Schema

To create a schema, a file with a `.cfgu.json` extension needs to be created to store the details
of your configuration schema in JSON format. The simplest way to do this is to run:

```sh
configu init --name some-schema
```

... somewhere in your source repository where it can be tracked. You should track these files 
like any other code. You can create as many `.cfgu.json` files as you need, and we encourage 
you to use Configu for any tool that exists in your development workflow - even ad-hoc build scripts. 

To create a new configuration with a small demonstration schema, run `configu init --examples` which 
will give you an overview of how types, defaults, notes and templates work together. 

## Changing A Schema

You can add as many keys of any type as you wish to your configuration as your application evolves. 
You should treat your `.cfgu.json` files as the **source of truth** for your configuration schemas, 
and use your version control to manage versions and changes as they're coupled to your applications.

Ordinary maintenance tasks are changing the default values, notes, templates and patterns associated 
with your schema, which is easy to accomplish by editing the associated `.cfgu.json` file as needed 
and letting it go through your existing review / PR process.

Once you want to initialize values and create a set for it, you can use `configu upsert` 
[(Read more on how to manage values)](/sets).

Our IDE plugins provide very convenient completion and lookup to make this process as simple as possible.

## Renaming & Deprecation

If you need to **rename** a schema key, you can do this, just be aware that changing the name 
is actually two operations:

 - The key (as we know it) is deprecated
 - A new key with the new name or type is then added

Deprecation is a sort of 'soft' delete - we remove the configuration key from Configu's view when 
filling sets, but we keep a reference to it in case of rollback. Users with Administration access 
can prune deprecated keys as needed.

## Deleting A Schema

<Admonition type="warning">
Be sure about deleting a schema!
</Admonition>

Note that unlike configuration keys, **schemas themselves are hard-deleted, not deprecated**, 
so please be sure that's what you want to do. They can be re-created by restoring them in your 
repository, and upserting them again in the event that you make a mistake.

You should favor having a team admin periodically prune deprecated keys from schemas instead 
of re-creating them; you really only want to delete a schema if it won't be needed in the future.

You can delete schema using the `delete` command

```sh
configu delete --schema "some-schema"
```
