As applications are becoming more dynamic and distributed in microservices, configurations are also fragmented. 
They are saved as raw text that is spread across multiple stores, databases, files, git repositories, and third parties (An average company has between 5 to 10 different stores).

The [Configu open-source](https://github.com/configu/configu) solution is a powerful standalone tool designed to address this challenge by providing a Configuration Orchestration along with CaC model.

## Configuration Orchestration 
The Configu Orchestrator enables the seamless management of configurations across different storage systems (e.g. files in your git repo, secret managers, feature flags, DBs) and across various environments from code to runtime. 
It provides a unified interface that allows developers to define and deploy configurations consistently, ensuring that the desired settings are applied accurately throughout the 
entire software development lifecycle. By automating the configuration orchestration process, this feature helps reduce manual work and errors and promotes efficient deployments.

Configu orchestrator includes two interfaces that can sync to any configuration store that you use and manage (CRUN, test and automate) and automate the configuration process
- [CLI interface](/cli) - single set of commands
- [SDK interface](/sdk) - unified interface for each supported programing language

## ConfigSchema - CFGU
ConfigSchema file (.cfgu.json or .cfgu.yaml) is a human-readable and open-source format used for declaring configurations and their characteristics. 
It is designed to be stored alongside code in source control, bind between the configurations to the code and helps to make the code the single source of truth. 
It is treated as code since it does not contain sensitive data. The format provides a structured way to associate configuration keys in the code with their properties, 
such as data type, requirement level, and constraints. By utilizing ConfigSchema, configuration data can be properly validated, preventing misconfigurations and errors 
from reaching production. There isn't any unique identifier to the .cfgu files, and developers have the flexibility to organize and structure these files according to 
their specific needs and workflows.

## Common Use Case

**Plug and Play** - Have multiple microservices and fragmented configurations across git repos and several tools like secret managers, databases, and feature flag solutions?
Integrate Configu Orchestrator into your existing SDLC without migrating or changing anything and gain a powerful unified interface that can help you to empower developers, prevent misconfigurations, improve collaboration, and automate the entire configuration process with only two simple steps:
    - Adopt Configu's CaC model and declare your microservices using the .CFGU format (which can be autogenerated out of your existing configurations using the `configu init --import` command)
    - Combine Configu CLI commands in your CI/CD tools or directly in your Docker files/K8s so every new release the latest configuration will be tested, clear from misconfiguration, and deployed to the right place automatically.

For example: if your configurations are stored in .env files, DB, Hashicorp Vault, and AWS Parameter Store all you need to do is build a .CFGU for the microservices and add Configu CLI as a step in your GitHub Action and that's it!
