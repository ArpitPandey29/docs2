title: Configuration as code (CaC)
---

CaC is a concept that refers to managing and deploying configurations in a software system using code and version control systems, similar to how you manage your application code.

Traditionally, configurations in software systems were managed through manual processes or configuration files that were edited directly. 
This approach often led to inconsistencies, manual errors, duplications and difficulty in tracking changes over time. 
Configuration as code aims to address these challenges by treating configurations as part of the application's codebase.

With our configuration as code format (CFGU), the configuration declaration is written and stored alongside the application's source code in a version control system like Git. 
This allows for the same practices and tools used for code management, such as versioning, branching, code review, and collaboration, to be applied to configurations without storing 
the values themself and risking a leak of sensitive values or even secrets or leaving the IDE for a 3rd party tool.

By using configuration as code, you can achieve several benefits:

1. **Version control:** Configurations can be versioned alongside the code, allowing you to always match between them, roll back to previous versions, and have a historical record of all modifications.

2. **Reproducibility:** Configurations become part of the deployment pipeline, ensuring that the same configuration is used consistently across different environments or deployments without the need of duplicating and synchronizing every change you made, on each one of them.

3. **Testing and validation:** Configuration code can be tested, validated, and linted like any other code, helping catch errors, inconsistencies, or potential issues before deployment.

4. **Collaboration and documentation:** Configuration files can be reviewed, commented on, and updated collaboratively, enabling teams to work together effectively and share knowledge about the system's configuration.

Popular infrastructure tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, and Terraform provide infrastructure as code capabilities, allowing you to manage them better in a consistent and automated manner.

In summary, configuration as code brings the benefits of version control, automation, consistency, and collaboration to the management and deployment of configurations, making it easier to maintain, track, and apply configurations across different environments and deployments.
