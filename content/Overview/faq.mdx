## What is the difference between secret managers, feature flag solutions, and Configu?

While both secrets and feature flags are implementations of application configurations, secret managers, feature flag solutions and Configu are different.

Application configurations are fragmented, they are saved as raw text that is spread across multiple stores, databases, files, and third parties.
Part of this fragmentation happened since each niche of application configuration has its dedicated storage which specializes in this niche, 
like secret managers that securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords or feature flag solutions that enable the management of feature releases and experiments dynamically.

Configu, on the other hand, is not focused on a specific niche but rather on the fragmented workflow itself and can manage and fetch the configs from all these stores together using a single set of commands.
Configu automates the configuration workflow from code to runtime across all environments and lets you manage configurations through one interface that rules them all.

This makes Configu's approach more robust and reliable, allowing it to prevent misconfigurations, and duplications and provide visibility, test framework, security and compliance standardization abilities.

## Can I use other products to store my configurations with Configu (e.g. Git repository, ASM, Hashicorp Vault)?

Of course! [Configu orchestrator](/configu-orchestrator) is an open source and supports many different [storage options](/config-store) like ASM, Hashicorp Vault and even files on a git repository.
You can also create [your own store](/build-store) for your benefit and others.

## Can I fetch configurations with Configu if I'm offline?

Yes. you have three ways to fetch configs offline:

- Fetch the default values directly from the `.cfgu` schema

    ```shell
    configu eval --schema 'my-schema.cfgu.json' --defaults
    ```

- Use the last fetch, Configu saves the latest fetched configuration in a local cache.
- Use the self-hosted store, if you're using Configu for orchestrating local files, local DB or running Configu's self-hosted version you can do everything offline.   

## Is there a free version of Configu?

Definitely, both [Configu orchestrator](/configu-orchestrator) and our community version are free and the best part is that it's free forever.
