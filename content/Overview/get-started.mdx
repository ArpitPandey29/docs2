Learn how to quickly get started with Configu.
We'll use the Configu's CLI and the Configu's Saas Configuration Store to decalre, initalize, and export a simple set configuration data.

### 1. Install the Configu CLI

<CliInstallSnippet />

### 2. Declare a Config schema

```shell
configu init --get-started
```

### 3. Use a Config Store

```shell
configu store upsert --type "configu"
```

<Admonition>
  
[Configu SaaS Store](https://app.configu.com/) is a convenient way to get started with Configu, especially for users who are new to the platform. It provides a cloud-based configuration management solution that is easy to use and requires minimal setup.
To get started with [Configu SaaS Store](https://app.configu.com/), you'll need to [register and create a new organization](https://app.configu.com/).

It's important to note that Configu SaaS Store is just one of many options for storing and managing configuration data with Configu. If you have specific requirements or preferences, you may wish to explore other ConfigStore options, such as using a database, a secret manager, or your own custom implementation.

### 4. Upsert Config values to a "test" Config Set

```shell
configu upsert \
--store "configu" --set "test" --schema "./getting-started.cfgu.json" \
--config "GREETING=hey" --config "SUBJECT=<YOUR_NAME>"
```

### 5. Export the configuration data

```shell
configu export \
--store "configu" --set "test" --schema "./getting-started.cfgu.json" \
--format "Dotenv" \
> ".env"
```

and you will get a .env file for the "getting-started" ConfigSchema configurations from the "test" ConfigSet.

```.env
GREETING=hey
SUBJECT=<YOUR_NAME>
BAZ=hey, <YOUR_NAME>!
```

That's it! You should now have a simple set of configuration data stored in the Configu SaaS Store, ready to be used in your application.
