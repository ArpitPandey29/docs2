Learn how to quickly get started with Configu.
We'll use the Configu CLI and the Configu Cloud Configuration Store to declare, initialize, and export a simple set of configuration data.

### 1. Install the Configu CLI

<CliInstallSnippet />

### 2. Declare a ConfigSchema

```shell
configu init --get-started
```

### 3. Connect a ConfigStore

```shell
configu login
```

<Admonition>
  
The [Configu Cloud Store](https://app.configu.com/) is a convenient way to get started with Configu, especially for users who are new to the platform. It is a cloud-based configuration management solution that is easy to use and requires minimal setup, with a free plan option.
To get started with [Configu Cloud](https://app.configu.com/), you'll need to [register and create a new organization](https://app.configu.com/).

It's important to note that [Configu Cloud](https://app.configu.com/) is just one of many options for storing and managing configuration data with Configu. If you have specific requirements or preferences, you may wish to explore other ConfigStore options, such as using a database, a secret manager, or your own custom implementation.

### 4. Upsert Config values to a "test" ConfigSet

```shell
configu upsert \
--store "configu" --set "test" --schema "./get-started.cfgu.json" \
--config "GREETING=hey" --config "SUBJECT=<YOUR_NAME>"
```

### 5. Export the configuration data

```shell
configu export \
--store "configu" --set "test" --schema "./get-started.cfgu.json" \
--format "Dotenv" \
> ".env"
```

As a result, you will get a `.env` file with the configurations declared in the "get-started" ConfigSchema and their values from the "test" ConfigSet.

```.env
GREETING=hey
SUBJECT=<YOUR_NAME>
BAZ=hey, <YOUR_NAME>!
```

That's it! You now have a simple set of configuration data stored in the [Configu Cloud](https://app.configu.com/), ready to be used in your application.
