title: Understanding Configu's Types
---

One of the core values of Configu is its ability to validate and enforce types for your
configurations. Configu's types help guard against accidents in configuration
updates, and makes your schema easier for humans to understand.

To manage this, Configu implements the following type allowances in configuration objects, 
which is what schemas become once pushed:

 - Primitive, basic types like numbers, strings, booleans, hex and others are valiadtaed based
 purely on their content. If your schema declares a number and you give it a string, Configu will
 issue an error, and you won't be able to validate or push the configuration until you fix it.

 - Patterns, which are needed to fulfill additional expectations for types like regex. A Pattern
 is needed for any type that can't be checked against itself or a pre-defined pattern (e.g. email, 
 mobile phone number)

 - Templates, which are patterns that combine multiple values from the current schema or others 
 schemas along with other characters, e.g. in order to build a query URL to fetch a feed.

Configu schemas also promote human discovery by including a _note_ field for every key. Notes are 
optional but strongly encouraged, even if the schema seems obvious right now.

## Table Of Available Types

For convenience and reference, we keep the table below up-to-date with the different types that 
Configu supports.

Fields identified in the "Also Requires" column indicate additional data that you need to specify 
in order to use a certain type. For instance, using the "Regex" type requires "pattern" also be 
specified. We recommend that `note` be specified for human-friendly lookup with every Schema key; 
the table below shows what's mandatory.
