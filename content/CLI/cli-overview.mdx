The `Configu CLI` is the easiest interface for getting started with Configu. With the command-line interface (CLI), you can easily interact with Configu using a terminal or an automated system, providing you with all the functionality you need to orchestrate your configuration data and beyond.

## Installation

The [CLI code is open-source](https://github.com/configu/configu/tree/main/ts/packages/cli), and the [installation process](/cli-setup) is quick and easy, with lightweight binaries available for all major operating systems, Docker, and CI/CD platforms.
