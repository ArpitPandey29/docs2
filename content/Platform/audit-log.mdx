Know when changes are made and by who.
From modifying a Config to adding a new team member, Configu will generate logs for every action your team members make.

Activity logs record all actions going through the Configu store including who performed and when, from which interface and which CRUD operations on Configs or Sets. 
They help you view:
- Who added or updated the configuration recently
- Which service pulls his latest configurations and when
